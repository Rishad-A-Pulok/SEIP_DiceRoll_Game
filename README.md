Problem Statement

You roll two dice. 
Each of the dice has six faces, which contain one,two,three,four,five and six spots respectively. 
After the dice have come to rest, the sum of the spots on the topupward faces is calculated.

Possible situations are:
1. If the sum is 7 or 11 on the first throw, you win.
2. If the sum is 2 or 3 or 12 on the first throw(called "craps"), you loose(i.e. the "house" wins)
3. If the sum is 4 or 5 or 6 or 8 or 9 or 10 on the first throw, that sum becomes your "points"
4. To win, you must continue rolling the dice until you "make your points again"(i.e. roll that same point value)
5. You loose by rolling a 7 before making your point
